# Statistical Analysis of Top 1000 Grossing Movies

## Abstract

Large production movies require significant upfront investments, with significant "make or break" questions arising from the initial predictions. This financial risk has piqued interest within the statistical analysis community to determine whether the investment provides significant returns of profitability. This study examines the top 1000 grossing movies of all time across the world and attempts to determine the statistical significance of worldwide lifetime earnings as a function of budget through a linear regression model. Additionally, other data was examined as a function of worldwide revenue, including local US gross earnings, movie ratings, metascore, and duration.
